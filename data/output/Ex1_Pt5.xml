I've considered playing with less to make it simpler for new players, and likewise more to add possibilities for players that are already familiar with the card types, but I've never heard of anyone else trying it before. It would throw off the end conditions (one of which is running out of three stacks of Kingdom cards, which is respectively more/less likely in my examples); would it unbalance any other game aspects or lead to problems?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I think playing with less would be fine.  From the games I've played with there are about 2-5 stacks that never get any buys, and 1-2 that get bought down really fast.  For inexperienced players I think it would be a big plus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, for experienced players it could change some of the strategy a bit.  The other stacks, even if unbought, can serve as a threat that players may buy those.  For example, if there were multiple reaction cards then the attack cards seem less desirable.  So right there 2-4 stacks may be off-limits on the premise of mutually assured destruction.  However, with no reactions attack cards gain a lot of value.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus adding more cards would be bad IMHO for experienced and inexperienced players but for different reasons.  The inexperienced players would be too confused while the experienced players would settle on 'sure fire' strategies with so many other strategies to game against.  A limited selection limits the amount of competing strategies, and hence may reduce the number of spoilers to more entertaining card selections.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;There are three versions of the Carcassonne rules; citing &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_%28board_game%29&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In the first and second editions of the game, completed cities covering just two tiles scored two points (one per tile) and one extra point for every pennant that resides in the city. This exception is removed from the third edition, in which there is no difference between two-tile cities and cities of larger size.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The greatest divergence in scoring rules between the editions of Carcassonne is in scoring for fields. In the first edition, the players with the greatest number of followers adjacent to a city were awarded four points for that city. Thus, followers from different fields contributed to the scoring for a city, and followers on a field may contribute to the scoring for multiple cities. The second edition considered different fields separately — for each field, the players with the greatest number of followers in a field scored three points for each city adjacent to the field, although points were only be scored once for any given city. The third edition removes these exceptions and brings field scoring in line with the scoring of other features.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would imagine that tournaments will typically use the newest official version of the rules, but for recreational play there is no such thing as &quot;correct&quot; rules.

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;In my experience, cloister tiles in Carcassonne are often &quot;too lucky&quot;. If you draw a cloister tile in the beginning of the game, it will typically still require an investment of quite a bit of &quot;meeple&quot; time to obtain the full 9 points, which makes it a fair trade-off. However, after about half of the game, it's relatively likely that you can &quot;parachute&quot; a cloister tile in some spot and get 8 or 9 points immediately. This adds a lot of randomness to the game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What house rules work well to diminish this effect?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;It's normally a very good idea to castle early, but 'as soon as possible' is not really a correct rule. It depends on a number of factors, including your choice of opening, and your opponent's response.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Leaving your king in the middle of the board is a bad idea. Your pieces can be pinned, you're much more vulnerable, and your rooks can become isolated, trapped on the sidelines. One exception to this rule sometimes arises if you have exchanged queens. Once this happens it is considerably harder to mount a successful direct mid-game assault on the king, and it may sometimes be reasonable in this situation to treat the king as an additional fighting piece, rather than as a delicate thing to hide away on the sidelines and protect at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of rare openings where not castling is a valid strategy, but they are unusual. Castling does not occur, or occurs very late, in some variations of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_defense&quot;&gt;French Defense&lt;/a&gt;.

Sometimes giving up castling is a valid line for white, as happens for example in some variations of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessopening?eco=C33&quot;&gt;King's Gambit Accepted&lt;/a&gt; such as the King's Bishop's Gambit, where Black checks on h4, and white plays Kf1.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Short answer - No.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I used to try research when I first learned the game, but now I see no point in it.  I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; seen players who still insist on researching for the off-chance of getting long-range heavy bombers, and then going the whole game without getting it.  That seems like a complete waste to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your cause looks close to hopeless, you're probably out of luck anyways.  I guess you could research weapons development as a way to speed up the game and get closer to finishing, instead of buying units, but I rather fight to the finish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can get an armor for 5 IPC every turn -- I would much prefer that.

Light blue is good because the buildings are very cheap but give excellent returns. Orange is good because the likelihood of landing there is substantially higher, due to forced starting from Jail (gets you on a 6, 8 or 9). Finally, the dark blues are a good choice because &lt;em&gt;eventually&lt;/em&gt; someone will draw the &lt;code&gt;Advance to Mayfair&lt;/code&gt; card.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a much more &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tkcs-collins.com/truman/monopoly/monopoly.shtml&quot;&gt;detailed analysis here&lt;/a&gt;.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Small World&lt;/strong&gt;, as soon as you discover that someone has a combo that seems powerful you need only to do a couple things&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Kill off any declined empire of his&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Regularly snipe a territory or two of his every turn.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If at least one other players agrees with you, the declined empire should be gone by the start of his second turn with the powerful combo (at the latest).  Without a declined empire regularly gaining a few VPs/turn, it is very hard to win.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next you have to deal with the elves.  You definitely don't want him expanding to 8 territories and taking 16VPs/turn!  8 elves can be knocked back pretty easily.  He has no combat bonuses on either offense or defense, so you should be able to reduce him to a max of 2 territories at the start of his turn pretty fast.  Bottle him up with stacks 2-3 high, this will limit his expansion and should keep his VP generation below yours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't be afraid to go into decline early and often.  Grab any combo with a combat advantage of some sort and exploit it.  Once it plays out, get another one.  The Merchant Elves will be stuck fighting for the same 2-4 territories every turn until he goes into decline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Merchant only gives +2 troops, everything else except Fortified (+3) gives at least +4 troops.  This means that Merchant is meant to be a very powerful ability, on the other hand, you will almost certainly outnumber him.  Grab a combat oriented power on top of that and the battles should greatly favor you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some combos that might be particularly annoying to the merchant elves are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Flying Ratmen or Amazons (attack his soft underbelly with a ton of troops)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mounted Skeletons should have him restricted to the mountains in no time&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Stout anything - just throw them at him and go get another empire while he cleans up the carnage&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Commando Giants - grab mountains, anything around them will probably fall to 1 attacking giant!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;"/>

Takes a lot of actions to get up and running, but will then produce a lot of food.  In 2-3 player games coming up with stone can be an issue.  With 4-5, the one sow/bake action can be problematic to obtain when you need it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fireplace&lt;/strong&gt; (3 clay): Less important than the 2 clay version.  Paying extra to be the second person in a food engine isn't great.  Better to get the extra clay and go straight to a Cooking Hearth in most cases.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stone Oven&lt;/strong&gt;: The victory points are the main thing here.  Taken late in many games for the VP and the free bake action&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basketmaker's Workshop&lt;/strong&gt;: Collecting all the reed can deny other players house expansion, buying this gives you something to do with all the reed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pottery&lt;/strong&gt;: With the right minors you can make something of this, otherwise it is just 2 VPs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joinery&lt;/strong&gt;: It isn't too many games that you have much extra wood.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Implied odds or implied pot odds are calculated the same way as pot odds, but consider future betting. You figure implied odds in situations where you expect to fold in the next round if you don't make your draw. You lose no more bets if you miss, but can expect to gain extra bets if you hit the draw.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An example. Say you see the flop with 2 other players acting before you in a NL game. You flop a gutshot straight draw. The first player bets and the second calls and now the pot is laying you 7:1. For a gutshot you want 10:1 or better; however, if you hit your straight on the turn, you stand to stack off one or both of your opponents. Thus your implied odds are considerably greater than 7:1, so you call. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Implied odds with a flush draw can be dicier. Namely because you can hit your flush on the turn and that kills the action. And your implied odds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The example is a very simple one. If you were in the same scenario, but 2nd to act instead of last; you would be in a much different situation in that the last player could raise and ruin (or not) your implied odds. Additionally, stack sizes matter. If your opponents are short stacked you may not have the odds for the call. So, when considering implied odds be very aware of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The bankroll is your safe haven. The bankroll is what makes you different from a gambler, betting, bet again, breaks and puts more money in the game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bankroll is a fundamental part of you being a poker player. Treat it with due importance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bankroll should be large. It's more than you think you need. It is much larger than you want it. The truth is that you need a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why you need a lot? Because of something called a variance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You know that poker is a game of skill, but in the short term, luck plays a great importance. Even the best players end up having to go through hard times. This is part of the game and every player should be able to handle it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fact that your bankroll vary up and down over the course of the game is known as variance. The more aggressive style, the greater the variability. And the more you play a game of high variance (as MTT or 6-max), the greater the ups and downs will meet your bankroll.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is no escaping the variance. Even if you are prudent and cautious, your bankroll will experience ups and downs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When in high, it's just joy, but the low that you need a good bankroll. You need a box that allows you to resist the bad times without breaking. Because if you break, will not be able to enjoy the sound stage, which will certainly come back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bankroll should always be calculated in relation to buy-ins or stakes of the games you want to play.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A bankroll of $ 1000 can be big or little ... depends on the buy-in. If you're playing $ 5 SNG's (Sit and Go) tournament, this is a pretty good bankroll. Have to play $ 50 SNGs, it is little.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A bankroll of $ 2000 is big enough for you to face without fear NL cash tables 0.10 to 0.20. But the same bankroll can not stand the jolt of the NL tables 1-2.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are methods to calculate the bankroll according to your ROI, ie its return on investment. I do not advise a beginner to use this method. To know your ROI and you need a good time and a lot of hands in poker tournaments or played (even many). Moreover, the game changes, changing tables, opponents change. Your ROI will not be the same as six months ago, it will fluctuate a lot over time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So for those just starting out, I suggest being guided by the amount of buy-ins. It is simpler and is guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I said above, in relation to the bankroll, you better be cautious. Here are my recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cash games&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;6-Max: 100 buy-ins&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Down to level 60 with buy-ins&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Full Ring: 80 buy-ins&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Down to level 55 with buy-ins&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tournaments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sit and Go: 50 buy-ins&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Level down to 30 buy-ins&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;MTT: 100 buy-ins&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Down to level 60 with buy-ins&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These numbers mean the minimum number of buy-ins that you must have to a certain level and when you should go down a level.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, if you want to play SNG tournaments of $ 2, your bankroll should be $ 100. If your bankroll drops to $ 60 or less, switch to the $ 1 SNG.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to play $ 10 SNG, the bankroll should be $ 500. The bankroll has dropped below $ 300? Change to the $ 5 SNG. No need to take into account the rake calculation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In cash games, is the same thing with just one more detail: if you play with full stack, the value of each buy-in is the sum of 100 big blinds. If you are a shortstacker each buy-in is worth 20 big blinds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if you want to play 6-max 0.10-0.20, your bankroll should be $ 2000. If your bankroll drops below $ 1200, go to the games of 0.05-0.10.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are entering a shortstacker with 20% of the buy-in, your bankroll at 6-max from 010 to 0.20 to be $ 400. Where to stay under $ 240, get off of level.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

When delivering goods, you must choose where your points go, either to an income track (that goes from -10 to +10) or to your victory point track. Early in the game, you'd usually concentrate on income to grow your business, then at some point switch to VPs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is no board with randomized upcoming goods for each city and therefore no &quot;production&quot; action. Instead, 12 sets of 3 goods are available for use with the new &quot;city growth&quot; action or when you place down a new city tile while &quot;urbanizing&quot;. A startup city can only get one new set of goods with city growth, and urbanized cities cannot get another set after being placed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Smaller rule changes include tile costs, tile distribution, no income reduction, loco is not allowed if you're on 6 already, final scoring for tracks is 1 VP per &lt;em&gt;link&lt;/em&gt;, and when shipping you can't give more points to any other player.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/381942/steam-a-review-and-comparison-to-age-of-steam-3rd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;great review&lt;/a&gt; contains a more detailed list of differences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The order should proceed like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;All damage is assigned (leave the damage tokens near the unit to be damaged)  Note: a target may be over assigned damage at the player's discretion but this is not required except in the case of damage cancellation even when you know the unit will survive due to other protective effects&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Certain effects trigger and are resolved including redirecting damage.  In this case, the Priests are able to redirect one damage point, preferably to a unit with toughness&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Damage is moved onto the card, destroying any cards that still have damage equal to its hit points.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Source - FAQ and Rules on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=85&amp;amp;esem=4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Fantasy Flight's&lt;/a&gt; website&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I've tried playing Arkham Horror with 1, 2 and 4 players. I've found that the game seems extraordinarily difficult with less than 4 characters. Simply put, you don't have enough gos to do everything. Gates keep opening, monsters keep appearing, and it only takes 1 curse, a bad monster, or a couple of delayed turns and it's all over. Adding any expansions simply kicks the difficulty up further.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After several frustrating games, I now don't play with less than 4 characters. In a two player game, each of us takes two characters, and plays the game as if there were 4 players. This seems to give a better balance, but is a lot to remember and keep track of.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Has anyone had success playing Arkham with less than 4 characters?

You don't need to make any adjustment to the rules to do so, just make sure that you keep each character's possessions separate!  Also remember that certain game elements are based on the number of characters, not players.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One variation you might try is to play two people with one character each.  Just skip every other Mythos phase.  Essentially each character gets 2 turns between Mythos phases.  If you do this, consider yourselves to be playing a 4 character game for all relevant settings.  This will ease your bookkeeping headaches although it will also make the game a bit easier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To address your statement that you find the game difficult under 4 people, you aren't the only one!

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I'm afraid you do understand the ruling correctly (there is no GW statement on this that I'm aware of since there's no conflict in the two rules). The important thing to remember is that the substitution is optional - if you're likely to take massive damage from fearless, take a chance on the dice and use their adjusted leadership (adjusted for modifiers from the combat). I think that you will find that your decision on taking casualties vs risking a failed leadership check will greatly depend on the unit and what you're trying to do with it (a unit of 30 gretchin designed to hold up an assault squad is going to happily take the casualties while your boyz are likely to take their chances with a roll - though even these examples are dependent on what you're trying to do and the current situation on the table). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;While low interaction is a frequent critique of the game, I think most experienced players would tell you that you're not playing the game as effectively as you could. First, I'm assuming you're playing the game without the Brink of War rules which add direct player conflict to the game. Second, a large part of the subtlety of the game is the need to very carefully make decisions about role selection - optimally, you want to balance your selection against the roles you think other players will select while avoiding selections that benefit other players more than they benefit you (in other words, you want to maximize the value/activity you achieve during a term while minimizing the value/activity of your opponents).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another subtle point is the need to review other player's tableaus for point scoring combos - when you see someone else's combo fall into place, it's generally advisable to move the game to its end (unless of course your own combo is up and running and superior). The last tidbit that is typically overlooked is card denial. In most games of RftG, the deck will be shuffled a few times, increasing the odds that your opponents will get the chance to play rarer cards that can shift the victory point totals significantly. Holding on to cards that you intend to spend for a bit longer can mean that a useful card never sees play due to the timing of shuffles!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

One player calls out for the saboteurs to put their heads up and identify each other.  They put their heads back down, then everyone puts their heads up and starts playing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This lets the saboteurs be much more effective and strategic - if one of the other saboteurs reveals himself, you can play more cautiously to reserve for sabotage later.  You can also collaboratively lie about Map results if you want.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With my group of (fairly experienced) players this rule has resulted in a much more balanced ratio of wins for the good dwarves and the saboteurs, while not going so far as to outright allow the saboteurs to directly communicate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another house rule we use is to always guarantee the maximum number of saboteurs, rather than having a chance for one fewer as in the normal rules.

I can't help but feel excited that there's a lot of potential in the game, but that the rules are broken and in certain aspects, to be honest, downright absurd.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/GQBJc.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;SimCity: The Card Game&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am especially bothered by a number of things that are either annoying or out of balance:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The sheer amount of &lt;strong&gt;counting&lt;/strong&gt; the rules have you do.&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Once you have a decent city going, keeping track of the number residents within however many of blocks&amp;mdash;either by road or rail&amp;mdash;is a headache.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Worse yet, add a couple of &lt;em&gt;Receive # for every [card type] within # blocks&lt;/em&gt; into the mix, and you'll spend a good deal of the evening counting.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zoning bonuses&lt;/strong&gt; become crazy. Once a residential zone has reached a modest size, the value of putting &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; card down is dwarfed by the massive bonus of appending it to a zone. There's no sense in trying to close off a zone, either, because your opponent will eat you alive.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Council members&lt;/strong&gt; are useless. Never does the game reach a point in which rezoning is really an issue, because it takes too many members to veto the mayor and/or council chairman. You require much too many in the deck, and pretty much any other card yields more value in the long run.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;City services&lt;/strong&gt; pay off much too much. Put down a few schools and a few police stations, and you'll be &quot;adding&quot; &amp;amp; &quot;receiving&quot; yourself to bliss.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Many of the &lt;strong&gt;event cards&lt;/strong&gt; are either extremely focused on the council, or, like &lt;em&gt;Fire!&lt;/em&gt;, extremely destructive.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase one cards&lt;/strong&gt; pollute your deck once you have passed beyond that phase, but there's a dilemma: you can't really have less than a third of your deck filled with them unless you intend to sit around collecting cards for the first hour or so.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of these rules might be somewhat alleviated by limiting the playing area to something like 6&amp;times;6, and having the good sense not to add too many city services, but that doesn't cut it for me. I sometimes get the impression that I might not be fully understanding the rules, but the official rulebook leaves so many questions unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For some reason, I feel very attached to the game, but the rules just let me down.

I don't know the game in question, so I don't know what the possible outcomes are, but you could assign different point values to different results; winning gets you 1 point, losing gets you 0, and Rome falling gets everyone -1. Then people will have an incentive not to let Rome fall; if they do, they will lose rank compared to other players not in that game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By the way, this sort of brinksmanship between the fall-of-Rome-is-a-loss and fall-of-Rome-is-a-draw crowds may be an intentional feature of the game.

There are other Go servers as well; there's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://senseis.xmp.net/?GoServers&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; on Sensei's Library.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in reviewing older games, not watching live games, there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://senseis.xmp.net/?GoDatabases&quot;&gt;many professional games&lt;/a&gt; available for purchase or sometimes even free download, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gogod.co.uk/&quot;&gt;&quot;Games of Go on Disk&quot;&lt;/a&gt; collection. Or if you prefer paper, you can find collections of games by master players, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://senseis.xmp.net/?InvincibleTheGamesOfShusaku&quot;&gt;Honinbo Shusaku&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://senseis.xmp.net/?WuQingyuansCollectedGames&quot;&gt;Go Seigen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Statistically, I think the Axis get the short end.  I tried finding some web site specifically discussing stats on various countries, but came up empty, so you'll have to settle for qualitative data from me at least.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I havn't played this game in years, but I always like playing Russia.  I would say Russia is the best in terms of fun to play, but it's not the strongest.  Overall, A&amp;amp;A is an economic game &amp;amp; the Allies have the advantage.  So from that perspective, the US &amp;amp; UK might be considered 'best countries', if there is such a thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you like playing the Axis side, I would rank Germany as having a small advantage on the first turn, but it erodes quickly. If you haven't wiped out the British fleet early in the game and made solid progress into Africa by the time the Americans start showing up, well... lets just say a bunker suicide might not sound so bad after all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A risky strategy has Germany taking Leningrad early.  If you can hold it at the beginning of your turn, the game is basically over. You have to have plenty of luck on your side.  A safer approach is to go for Africa &amp;amp; have Japan invade Asia&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;UK, US &amp;amp; Russia are all good late game countries.  If you can keep a UK fleet alive through the early phases of the game, you can effectively pin Germany down in Europe build up major industry in India.  Early in the game, the UK is mostly a punching bag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As Russia, you can prevent an early assault by massing infantry on you borders, especially against Germany. You make attacks against you prohibitively expensive, but you are free to send waves of infantry into Germany if you see any weakness there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Links:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.criticalgamers.com/archives/board-games/strategies_for_wwii.php&quot;&gt;http://www.criticalgamers.com/archives/board-games/strategies_for_wwii.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.axisandallies.org/taxonomy/term/27&quot;&gt;http://www.axisandallies.org/taxonomy/term/27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;"/>

Often you find that a card doesn't fit or '&lt;em&gt;play nice with others&lt;/em&gt;' and should come out.  Same with cards that you draw and think &amp;quot;I wish I hadn't drawn that&amp;quot;.  Those cards come out also.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So to summarize, when testing ideas, 60+ is okay.  For tournament play, reduce to 60.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

It's one of the few games for two that I really enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To answer your question, maybe we haven't fully explored the possible strategies, but we find that the game is quite biased in favour of the Inspector. Other people who have played with us seem to agree. Also, I discovered while browsing the web that there are extensions (referred to &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/514359/i-love-it-but-its-just-not-the-same-&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, for example) that make the game more balanced.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a related note, while Jack sometimes win, I have only once seen him win by escaping (and that was because of a terrible mistake made by the Inspector). All the other times I've seen Jack win, it was by reaching the last turn, or by the inspector accusing someone at random because time was short anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

I'm looking for games with similar scope, time requirements, cost, and complexity to &lt;em&gt;Settlers of Catan&lt;/em&gt; that play well with two adult players. I'm not especially concerned by the level of cooperation or competition required, but I'd like to avoid anything especially blood-thirsty.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;There is no hard and fast answer for a good placement in Stratego, in part because as soon as someone learns your regular setup they can easily counter.  Many good strategies can work once but not regularly.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, common logic is to keep the flag in the back of your field surrounded by bombs.  Corners are also great because they only require two bombs instead of three to cover.  Both are excellent strategies with the weakness being predictability.  It is still a good idea to protect a flag on as many sides as possible with mines.  Setting up dummy flags with a Sergeant in wait for a miner is also common.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite ploys is to leave the flag behind one of the lakes unprotected, or protected only on one side or both as not to be conspicuous.  Many players will assume that the flag is in the back row and go charging past that ignored Lieutenant or Sergeant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also commonly pick one of my three entrances and double bomb it off.  If the other player is set to attack all three fronts evenly it can throw a kink in their plans as they need to move a miner in to clear the way.  Also the miner is sure to be gobbled up as soon as it defuses one of the mines to clear a path.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

This will make it much harder to get to 15,000 (you need a minimum of 3 building groups to get there).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Furthermore, the rules clearly state that 15,000 is the &lt;strong&gt;maximum&lt;/strong&gt; share price, so even if you still manage to arrange to shoot to 16,000 or higher, you will be limited to 15,000.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I, (and the folks over on the 'geek) would recommend that you add these rules to your game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I have used Quickshade and the much cheaper but equally effective Minwax polyshade on roughly one hundred miniatures. This pictures most definitely are not Photoshopped, but it's not quite the magic bullet as it seems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While it certainly is a way to quickly finish a large number of models there are a few disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) It leaves a gloss finish on your model that, except in a few cases, is generally undesirable, which requires the application of a matt varnish to eliminate. Often times, though, you will want to protect the paint anyway, so it may or may not be an extra step.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) It requires a bit more prep work. Mold lines on your models, along with any imperfection, become accentuated with Quickshade, but again, that's the case if you use a wash anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) It's messy. I brush the stuff on, but the technique is called &quot;dipping&quot; because the technique first involved dipping the entire model into the poly and then shaking/spinning it to remove the excess. In my case, after I get it on, I carefully brush off the excess, but it can easily pool in certain recesses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's a great way to get a large number of figures painted and ready for the tabletop quickly. A small container of Quickshade is roughly thirty US dollars, and the Minwax Polyshade (I prefer Tudor Satin), is about 8 dollars for a few pints.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is how I do it:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hivezero.blogspot.com/2010/09/speed-painting-tyranid-termagant.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://hivezero.blogspot.com/2010/09/speed-painting-tyranid-termagant.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a ton of other tutorials and galleries on the web.

    <Title Title="Lasting  games in the past century"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;One of the appeals of traditional games such as Chess, Go, Backgammon, or Poker is the depth that they have acquired over the years; long-standing communities and traditions, wide range of players from different backgrounds, depth of strategic analysis that has occurred over the years, and wide range of skill levels with very strong top players that comes about from years of study and training.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many newer games are mere flashes in the pan; fun for a while, but ultimately replaced after a few years with something newer and shinier. Many of them have the potential to gain such depth, but they are crowded in a field of other games, and do not really develop their own independent communities nor a significant pool of people to put in the time and dedication to create a strong competitive system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What recent games (defined as having been invented within the past century or so) have managed to achieve this sort of durability; their own cultures and communities, high-level tournament play, strong strategic analysis and a broad range of player skill? What games have not yet had time to (past 10 years or so), but do you feel have the seeds of such depth?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some criteria that can help determine if a game has reached this level. Not all criteria need apply, or may not apply exactly, but the more the better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Significant tournaments with professional or semi-pro players; or large amateur tournaments at a national or international level.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Official rating or ranking system (or more than one) with hundreds of players and a wide range of abilities represented.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Significant coverage in mainstream media, not just passing references or coverage in game-specific media.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Multiple independent publications discussing the game specifically (not as one of many, but dedicated to the game in question).

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I've been playing several games of Warhammer: Invasion Core Set with my friend and a couple of times we've encountered a situation where he had pretty good attack force set up in his battlefield and I has good one as well. But I already had one district burning and he had bunch of damage tokens on two of his districts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what I wanted to do in this situation is to attack his forces so his chances for gathering enough strength to finish me off would be smaller. I've attacked his battlefield and what he usually did is he didn't set any defenders and allowed the whole damage to be dealt to his district (even if it meant burning it down). Then in his turn he launch his full force agains one of my other districts and burn it down thus winning the game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was wondering are there any cards or rules in this game or it's expansions that would force him to fight me instead of letting all the damage to be dealt to his capital? This would allow for more tactical approach in my opinion because right now his best tactics is to ignore all my attacks and hope to get stronger force to destroy a district in one round then me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Many times, I have limited space to pack games, and don't know how many players there are going to be. I frequently end up in a situation in which we have 5 players, but games that only work with 3 or 4 players, or something of the sort. In these situations, games which are flexible in the number of players they support are useful; one or two such games can cover most situations you end up in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One problem is that while many games nominally work with a given number of players, they are really best played with a narrower range of players. For instance, there are many multi-player games that have a two-player variant, but the two-player variant is quite different than the multi-player game, and couldn't really be called the same game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, what games support a wide range of number of players well? Since there are many games which support 2-4 or 3-5 players, let's limit it to games that support at least 4 different player numbers well, such as 2-5 or 3-6 or any odd number from 7 to 15.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;edit to add&lt;/strong&gt;: Let's limit this to non-party games; party games as a genre tend to be fairly flexible in the number of players, so it's not all that interesting to list each one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

The other factor that changes is competition for cards - in a 2-player game you will mostly be able to get whatever cards you want, while a 6-player game will require more adjusting of your strategy on the fly to respond to cards going to other players.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All that said, the core gameplay works very well for any number of players from 2 to 6 without excessive special-case 2-player rules or dummy players.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;While this may seem disappointing, my advice is: don't.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Descent is a great game in its single-dungeon mode, and while it might look appealing to bring your characters from a dungeon to another, it actually &quot;just doesn't work&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the fun things about this game is the weapon progression: as you go on, you might find cooler weapons to use. This works well in a single dungeon, but is crap in the campaign: after just a few encounters it is likely that every player will have the best-in-slot weapon for that campaign level, and anything else they can find will just be sold away. This takes away a lot of fun from the game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moreover due to setting and stuff you end up wasting so much time playing just a couple of (short) encounters in the campaign, that you could have played a whole (much longer) dungeon in the standard game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you really want to keep a few things from one dungeon to another, you could keep the same characters, follow the standard rules about xp and progression, and change a character with another one if he dies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;h3&gt;Remove Your Bad Cards&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This involves slimming your deck down as small as possible by trashing or otherwise removing your starting Estates and Coppers (as well as any Curses you have ended up with).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Common cards that can enable this strategy (with set in parantheses):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Multiple Card Trash:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Chapel (B) - 4 cards&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Forge (P) - Any number of cards from your hand&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Steward (I) - 2 cards&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Single Card Trash:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Apprentice (A)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bishop (P)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Expand (P)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Loan (P)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lookout (S)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Masquerade (I)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Moneylender (B)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mine (B)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Remodel (B)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Salvager (S)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Trade Route (P)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Trading Post (I)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Transmute (A)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Upgrade (I)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remove Cards From Play:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Island (S)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Native Village (S)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Removing your starting Copper and Estates will let you draw your more powerful cards that you've bought more often.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>
